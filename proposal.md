# Project Proposal: Energy Consumption
**Luke Newman**

#### Domain
Dataset contains hourly energy consumption records over a 1 year timespan for over 1 thousand buildings in 15 different places around the world.  Along with the energy consumption records it has weather data during that time period as well.  

My goal is to perform time series analysis on the energy consumption records in hopes I can predict energy cost in future years.  Each of the 1000 buildings fall under different categories of education, office, and residential.  I want to make a tablea dashboard featuring the predicted energy consumption for each building type.  Also, if time permits I plan on mapping the weather data to places in the world which have similar weather data.
